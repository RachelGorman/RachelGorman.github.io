      <h2> Considerations and Questions</h2>
      <p>I am interested in exploring about how design and technology can use synchronization to help people regulate their physiology and feel more comfortable and at ease. Initial guiding questions include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. How can I help people feel calmer? More centered and aligned, less anxious and tense?</li>
        <li>2. How can I create a technology that feels comfortable or puts people at ease? Can I create a technology that feels inimate and gentle, empathetic and kind?</li>
        <li>3. How can technology help people soothe and self-regulate, meditate or be more mindful?</li>
        <li>4. Is there a way to synch ourselves to a healthier rhythm or better breathing pattern?</li>
        <li>5. If we feel something else's breathing, does our own breathing change?</li>
        <li>6. Can you power something with your body's electricity?</li>
        <li>7. Can we create tech that mimics the feeling of being around friendly animals or pets?</li>
        <li>8. Can we use biomaterials to achieve my objective?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To begin, I wanted to examine whether people were as anxious or tense as I presumed and what the nature of their anxieties were. I also observed my partner and my own behavior over a period of time to see if we engaged in self-regulating activities (and what those activities were).

          <figcaption>I created a physical data set that tracked the overt anxiety mentions I heard in a three-day period and served as a visual metaphor, reflecting a feeling of being "tied up in knots." </figcaption>

          <figcaption>I also tracked the subjects that people tended to worry about in my company, and the self-soothing behaviors that my partner and I performed over a two-day period.</figcaption>
