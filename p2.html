      <h2> Considerations and Initial Questions</h2>
      <p>I am interested in exploring about how design and technology can use synchronization to help people regulate their physiology and feel more comfortable and at ease. Initial guiding questions include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. How can I help people feel calmer? More centered and aligned, less anxious and tense?</li>
        <li>2. How can I create a technology that feels comfortable or puts people at ease? Can I create a technology that feels inimate and gentle, empathetic and kind?</li>
        <li>3. How can technology help people soothe and self-regulate, meditate or be more mindful?</li>
        <li>4. Is there a way to synch ourselves to a healthier rhythm or better breathing pattern?</li>
        <li>5. If we feel something else's breathing, does our own breathing change?</li>
        <li>6. Can you power something with your body's electricity?</li>
        <li>7. Can we create tech that mimics the feeling of being around friendly animals or pets?</li>
        <li>8. Can we use biomaterials to achieve my objective?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To begin, I wanted to examine whether people were as anxious or tense as I presumed and what the nature of their anxieties were. I also observed my partner and my own behavior over a period of time to see if we engaged in self-regulating activities (and what those activities were).

          </iframe>
           <figcaption>I created a physical data set that tracked the overt anxiety mentions I heard in a three-day period and served as a visual metaphor, reflecting a feeling of being "tied up in knots."

          <figcaption>I also tracked the subjects that people tended to worry about in my company, and the self-soothing behaviors that my partner and I performed over a two-day period.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I also wanted researched information that I thought was peritent to the project, and gathered a list of artists, orgaizations, and experts whose work spoke to the subjects I wanted to explore. They included: 
          <ol>
            <li>Roos Meerman/Filip Studios (KozieMe, Tactile Orchestra)</li>
            <li>Morton Heilig (Sensorama)</li>
            <li>Ultraleap (Hand-tracking/Haptics)</li>
            <li>Verner Panton (Visiona 2)</li>
            <li>Jinhyun Jeon (DessertSpoon Series)</li>


        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>While surveying other artist's work, both related and unrelated to my interests in comfort, synchronization, and human physiology, I noted the kinds of work that I tended to find most inspiring. Those aspects included: 
          <ol>
            <li>1. Work that is empathetic.</li>
            <li>2. Work that is focused on multi-sensory stimulation </li>
            <li>3. Work that is experienced alone.</li>
            <li>4. Work that is dreamy and delightful.</li>
            <li>5. Work that promotes tranquility and joy. </li>
            <li>6. Work that helps people emotionally connect with themselves, other animals, or the natural environment.</li>
            <li>7. Work that is soft, colorful, and inviting.</li>
          </ol>

        <h1>Continued Research<h1>
        <h2>Personal Inventory Survey</h2>
        <p>In order to gain a better understanding of the kinds of objects and features that people associate with comfort, I asked twenty one people to to answer the question: "what kinds of items bring you comfort or put you at ease?"

        <h1>Second Research Question</h1>
        <p>After researching the field and collecting data, my research question became: </p>
        <p>What is the relationship between our physical bodies, sensory input, physical objects, and our sense of calm, comfort, and ease?</p>though I know that will change upon further reflection.

        <h2>Expert Interview </h2>

        <p>An interview with Susan Pitler, a psychotherapist who focuses on treating patients using somatic experiencing techniques was conducted on Tuesday, Oct 5. A partial transcript from the first hour of the conversation is <a href=InterviewSusanPitler.pdf>HERE.</a></p>

        <p> Our conversation was more than two hours, but I collected the detailed takeaways in a document <a href=ConversationNotes.pdf>HERE.</a></p>
        <p>Major terms/concepts that she mentioned that I will continue to investigate:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Autonomic nervous system</li>
          <li>2. Sympathetic nervous system</li>
          <li>3. Parasympathetic nervous system </li>
          <li>4. Polyvagal nerve</li>
          <li>5. Co-regulation</li>
          <li>6. Orienting </li>
          <li>7. Sensory-related methods of de-activating an activation state including: heat, cold, massage, music, humming, and curling up</li>
        </ol></p>
<p>I am adding that to a list that I alread compiled after my conversation with Professor Sareen that included words like:</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Homeostatis</li>
  <li>Emotional regulation</li>
  <li>Physical regulation</li>
  <li>Warm technologu</li>
  <li>Soft technology</li>
  <li>Introceptive experiences</li>
</ol>
</p>
    <p>One of the more worrisome aspects of the conversation I had with Susan focused on how individual notions of comfort and safety are, because we all have different experiences and assocations with trauma. I am concerned that building something to address stress and trauma will not be customizable or personalizable enough to address people's specific needs.</p>

     <h1>Third Research Question</h1>

    <p>During this process of research and discovery, I also have begun to grativate back to speculative questions around technology, and particularly, how technology might operate if it were to be calm, comforting, friendly, or soft. After my in-class discussions with Jess Irish and others today, and after my conversation with Susan that emphasized how individual the concept of comfort can be, I may consider using technology as my departure point, rather than the idea of comfort and ease. That would mean that my research question could become something like:</p>

    <h3>What would technology look like if it weren't informed by its historic ties to the military-industrial complex?</h3>

    <p>I think this question would still allow me to focus on ideas of softness, comfort, and safety, but through a speculative design lens that feels more relevant to my interests and provides more room for imagination/is less tied to individual traumas and sensory associations. My reflection process is still ongoing.</p>
