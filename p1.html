        Partner Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Below is the statement that I recieved from my partner, Anna, describing the object that she lost.</p>
      <p><i>
        Right before moving to NY I received a lamp for my birthday. It was a lamp, where the  feathers covered the light bulb. through a small cage. Sadly, the feathers were lost the day I received the lamp. 
        <br>
        <br>
        It has a golden foot, which is not entirely straight but slightly imperfectly curved like a tree branch. It is resting on three small 'feet', shaped as an imperfect triangle. The colour of the structure is gold. Metal inside and copper-looking resin outside, shaped like a maple leaf texture, more natural. It is around 65cm to 80cm tall.
        On top there is a golden 'cage', shaped like a dome with small holes to place the feathers in. When the feathers are in place, the cage is completely covered and invisible (jist to give context how the feathers are kept in place).
        <br>
        <br>
        The feathers are soft, powder pink coloured. They represent the wings of the ostrich.

      <p> 
        Working on this project, I was struck by the benefits and drawbacks of the two different communication systems (the Latin alphabet and computer code) my partner and I used to convey the physical details of my partner's beloved "Ostrich Lamp." 
        <br>
        <br>
        Both languages allowed a certain level of detail that the other did not: my partner's words best conveyed her personal, emotional connection to the lamp, while my computer code was able to render her description into something visible, shareable, editable, and replicable. On the other hand, my partners' words left gaps in my complete understanding of the lamp she loved. And my computer code wasn't able to fully capture the organic shapes and textures that seemed essential to the nature of her object.
        <br>
        <br>
        All-in-all, this assignment felt like a game of telephone. As the image of the object passed from my partner, through her written description, to me and my interpretation of the object, to the computer code I used to render it, the gaps and limitations of both our imaginations and communication mediums opened space for misunderstandings and misinterpretations. For that reason, I am almost positive my final drawing does not reflect Anna's beloved lamp.
