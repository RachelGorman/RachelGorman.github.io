      <h2>Intial Assignment</h2>
      <p>Our initial assignment was to design, create, and install an interactive object or experience that was compelling and clear enough that members of the public would engage with it correctly without written text or verbal instruction. </p>

      <h3>Location Research and Activity Mapping </h3>
      <p>After surveying popular public gathering spaces via Google Maps, we decided to focus our research and activities on Fort Greene Park, in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
      <p>Fort Greene Park has been a Brooklyn landmark for more than <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fort-greene-park/history">150 years</a>. Originally the site was cleared for a military fort that was used by American soldiers in the Revolutionary War. After the War of 1812 was over, citizens began to use the space as an informal gathering place until the City of Brooklyn designated the area as a public park in 1845. Walt Whitman is on record <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2016/07/06/the-top-10-secrets-of-fort-greene-park-in-brooklyn/5/">supporting the park</a>, saying that it would become “a place of recreation...where, on hot summer evenings, and Sundays, they can spend a few grateful hours in the enjoyment of wholesome rest and fresh air."</p>

      <p>Today, the 30-acre park is neatly landscaped with playgrounds, tennis courts, and paved paths for people to enjoy. Because the park is so large, we began by creating heat maps of the space. We wanted to identify the areas of the park that people tended to gather, because we believe that locating our project in a popular area will improve its chances of interaction.</p>

        <p>After Mariel heat mapped the park, we determined that a large expanse at the corner of Dekalb St. and Washington Park Ave. would be the ideal location to center our activities. </p>

        <p>Once we had decided on an area of focus, I created behavioral maps and AEIOU studies on Sunday evening and Monday morning to get a sense of the kinds of people that visited the area of the park, what they did, and how they interacted with the space. </p>
        <p> My behavioral maps used symbols to convey the nature of the action and lines to delineate how people move through space.</p>

        <p>After mapping the area at different times a day, we discussed our takeaways and discovered, among other things, that:</p> 
        <ol>
          <li>1. Adults tended to use the environment as it was prescribed (walking on the path, sitting on benches) while children were more likely to interact with the natural parts of the environment/explore.</li>
          <li>2. Most adults were either accompanied by a handful of peers or by their children. Most were insular and focused on interacting with themselves, though some would interact with the environment if they were following their kids’ lead.</li>
          <li>3. Children tended to gravitate towards a large sandpit in the center of the observed area of the park and to a large rock on the edge of the observed area of the park, running between them (and dragging their parents with them). </li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Brainstorm & Concept</h3>
      <p>Once we had a sense of the park’s visitors and their interactions with the environment, we talked about the essential nature of the park, and the line it treads between the artificial and natural.</p>
      <p>We also touched on how we wanted to make people feel. Namely, that we wanted to create a sense of wonder and whimsy, to inspire feelings of natural abundance, and to play with the audience's expectations of the environment — to create something that both “gelled” with the surrounding area and was a departure from it.</p>
      <p>Finally, we teased out what action we wanted to encourage people to take. Harvesting, or pulling things off of an artificial tree, seemed like a direction that fit with our overall vision.</p>
       <figure>
       <iframe
          width="400px"
          height="533px"
          src="ThoughtMap.jpg">
          </iframe>
          <figcaption>We used a thought map to tease out our creative direction.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As we brainstormed, we thought through the kinds of edible and inedible objects that would compel visitors to harvest. As a part of our creative process, we got feedback from our classmates. Harvestable objects under consideration included:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li>1. Edible Fruit</li>
          <li>2. Unwrapped candy</li>
          <li>3. Wrapped candy</li>
          <li>4. Paper fortunes</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Ultimately we decided to create a whimsical tree festooned with fortunes that were made out of seed paper to cut down on waste and add an extra element to our design. We decided to paint the tree pink to call attention to its artificiality and attract maxium attention. 
          </p>
          <p>We also decided that we would place the tree in a popular area of the park, between two trees, near a highly-trafficked path for maximum visibility.

      <h3>Construction Exploration</h3>
      <p>Our first task was to figure out how to design and build an artificial tree that would stay stable and safe, even as the public interacted with it.</p>

          <figcaption>Our final version of our prototype included minature paper fortunes and pink tulle, an addition we thought would imbue the tree with a dreamy quality.

        <figure>

      <h3>Sketching and Mockup</h3>
      <p>Working first in Adobe Illustrator, and then in Aspire CNC Software, I developed a form that echoed our protype's stability but worked within the confines of two 4x8 pieces of plywood. I also added extra limbs to ensure that the piece was accessible for children, and adults of various height.

      <h3>Bringing the final vision to life</h3>
      <p>Once I had used the CNC machine to cut our tree figure out of Plywood, Mariel took over sanding and spray painting it pink. On the day of the installation, we also strung and handwrote 50 fortunes and wishes on seed paper that was cut to look like hearts. Our hope was that our variety  of messages would appeal to different individuals, and make them more likely to engage.</p>

       <h2>Intended Iteractions
      </h2>
      <p>In the project's final stages of our project, we decided to try to inpsire two seperate interactions:
        <ol>
          <li>1. Inspire people to take a seed paper heart with a pre-written fortune.</li>
          <li>2. Inspire people to write their own fortune on a blank seed paper heart and hang it on the tree.
          </li>
          </ol>
          </p> 
       <h2>
        Public Interactions and Iterative Process
      </h2>
      <p>We installed the Wishing Tree at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, NY from 12:00pm to 6:00pm on September 19, 2021. </p>

      <p><b>Intended interaction:</b> The public would take a seed paper heart from our tree and keep it for themselves </p>
      <p>
      <b>Actual interaction: </b> The public approached the tree and interacted with it, reading the fortunes but not taking them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Adjustments made:</b> We attached candy to the fortunes (see Iteration 2) and adjusted our filming position</p>

      <p><b>Intended interaction: </b>After realizing we were 1. Sitting too close, and 2. People were not taking the plain hearts, just reading them, we decided to attach candy as an incentive.</p>
      <p><b>Actual interaction:</b>It turns out bribery can be effective!</p>
      <p><b>Adjustments made: </b> We sat back into the grass rather than on the bench right in front of the tree, and tied the candy to strings and then onto the heart loops.</p>

      <h3>Iteration 2: Blank Seed Paper Hearts & Pens</h3>
      <p><b>Intended interaction:</b> The public would take a pen and use it to write their own fortune on a blank seed paper heart and hang it on the tree.</p>
<p><b>Actual interaction:</b> They did it!</p>
<p><b>
Adjustments made:</b> None. People almost immediately began taking seed paper hearts and writing on them without confusion.

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p></p>
      <h3>Intended & Unintended Interactions</h3>
      <p><b>Our iterations successfully inspired the interactions we were hoping for.</b>
</p>
<p>Unintended Interactions inluded:</p>
<ul><li>
 1. While we did initially expect people to take pictures, there were a lot who actually filmed/photographed and took selfies without actually taking anything. This drew out their interactions with the tree, upping time spent and hopefully creating that sense of wonder we were going for.</li>
 <li>2. We had a toddler actually give the tree a little lick - and also bring a bunch of bubbles over as well as his friends. </li>
 <li>3. A couple read through some fortunes and kissed and shared a moment and then walked away.</li>
      <h3>Core of the Experience</h3>
      <p>The core of the experience for the public seemed to be playful, meaningful, sweet, and shareable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. The installation’s pink hue was eye-catching and playful.</li>
        <li>2. The installation generated a sense of discovery as people read fortunes, found meaning in them, and shared them with one another.</li>
        <li>People tended to linger alone or together when reading the fortunes.</li>

      <h3>Ways to Push the Installation Further</h3>
      <p>A few ways that we might improve this project, were we to continue it, might be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1. Writing more thoughtful and varied fortunes for people to build meaning from.</li>
        <li>2. Iterating a more extensive installation that enhanced the public’s experience of wonder and discovery while bringing forward ideas about harvest, abundance, and nature/artifice more clearly.</li>
