      <h2> Considerations and Questions</h2>
      <p>I am interested in exploring about how design and technology can use synchronization to help people regulate their physiology and feel more comfortable and at ease. Initial guiding questions include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. How can I help people feel calmer? More centered and aligned, less anxious and tense?</li>
        <li>2. How can I create a technology that feels comfortable or puts people at ease? Can I create a technology that feels inimate and gentle, empathetic and kind?</li>
        <li>3. How can technology help people soothe and self-regulate, meditate or be more mindful?</li>
        <li>4. Is there a way to synch ourselves to a healthier rhythm or better breathing pattern?</li>
        <li>5. If we feel something else's breathing, does our own breathing change?</li>
        <li>6. Can you power something with your body's electricity?</li>
        <li>7. Can we create tech that mimics the feeling of being around friendly animals or pets?</li>
        <li>8. Can we use biomaterials to achieve my objective?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To begin, I wanted to examine whether people were as anxious or tense as I presumed and what the nature of their anxieties were. I also observed my partner and my own behavior over a period of time to see if we engaged in self-regulating activities (and what those activities were).

          </iframe>
           <figcaption>I created a physical data set that tracked the overt anxiety mentions I heard in a three-day period and served as a visual metaphor, reflecting a feeling of being "tied up in knots."

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>I also tracked the subjects that people tended to worry about in my company, and the self-soothing behaviors that my partner and I performed over a two-day period.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>While surveying other artist's work, both related and unrelated to my interests in comfort, synchronization, and human physiology, I noted the kinds of work that I tended to find most inspiring. Those aspects included: 
          <ol>
            <li>1. Work that is empathetic, delightful and kind. It does not dehumanize, fool, or embarass.</li>
            <li>2. Work that is visually or conceptually spectacular, giving audiences a sense of awe or wonder.</li>
            <li>3. Work that is focused on intimate human interactions, that is meant to be absorbed alone or in small groups.</li>
            <li>4. Work that is dreamy more than practical.</li>
            <li>5. Work that is tranquil over agitating. </li>
            <li>6. Work that helps people emotionally connect with themselves, other animals, and the natural environment.</li>
            <li>7. Work that is soft, colorful, and inviting</li>
          </ol>
