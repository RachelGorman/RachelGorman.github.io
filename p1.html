      <h2>Intial Assignment</h2>
      <p>Our initial assignment was to design, create, and install an interactive object or experience that was compelling and clear enough that members of the public would engage with it correctly without written text or verbal instruction. </p>

      <h3>Location Research and Activity Mapping </h3>
      <p>After surveying popular public gathering spaces via Google Maps, we decided to focus our research and activities on Fort Greene Park, in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
      <p>Fort Greene Park has been a Brooklyn landmark for more than <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/fort-greene-park/history">150 years</a>. Originally the site was cleared for a military fort that was used by American soldiers in the Revolutionary War. After the War of 1812 was over, citizens began to use the space as an informal gathering place until the City of Brooklyn designated the area as a public park in 1845. Walt Whitman is on record <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2016/07/06/the-top-10-secrets-of-fort-greene-park-in-brooklyn/5/">supporting the park</a>, saying that it would become â€œa place of recreation...where, on hot summer evenings, and Sundays, they can spend a few grateful hours in the enjoyment of wholesome rest and fresh air."</p>

      <p>Today, the 30-acre park is neatly landscaped with playgrounds, tennis courts, and paved paths for people to enjoy. Because the park is so large, we began by creating heat maps of the space. We wanted to identify the areas of the park that people tended to gather, because we believe that locating our project in a popular area will improve its chances of interaction.</p>
