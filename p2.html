      <h2> Considerations and Initial Questions</h2>
      <p>I am interested in exploring about how design and technology can use synchronization to help people regulate their physiology and feel more comfortable and at ease. Initial guiding questions include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. How can I help people feel calmer? More centered and aligned, less anxious and tense?</li>
        <li>2. How can I create a technology that feels comfortable or puts people at ease? Can I create a technology that feels inimate and gentle, empathetic and kind?</li>
        <li>3. How can technology help people soothe and self-regulate, meditate or be more mindful?</li>
        <li>4. Is there a way to synch ourselves to a healthier rhythm or better breathing pattern?</li>
        <li>5. If we feel something else's breathing, does our own breathing change?</li>
        <li>6. Can you power something with your body's electricity?</li>
        <li>7. Can we create tech that mimics the feeling of being around friendly animals or pets?</li>
        <li>8. Can we use biomaterials to achieve my objective?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To begin, I wanted to examine whether people were as anxious or tense as I presumed and what the nature of their anxieties were. I also observed my partner and my own behavior over a period of time to see if we engaged in self-regulating activities (and what those activities were).

           <figcaption>I created a physical data set that tracked the overt anxiety mentions I heard in a three-day period and served as a visual metaphor, reflecting a feeling of being "tied up in knots."

          <figcaption>I also tracked the subjects that people tended to worry about in my company, and the self-soothing behaviors that my partner and I performed over a two-day period.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I also wanted researched information that I thought was peritent to the project, and gathered a list of artists, orgaizations, and experts whose work spoke to the subjects I wanted to explore. They included: 
          <ol>
            <li>Roos Meerman/Filip Studios (KozieMe, Tactile Orchestra)</li>
            <li>Morton Heilig (Sensorama)</li>
            <li>Ultraleap (Hand-tracking/Haptics)</li>
            <li>Verner Panton (Visiona 2)</li>
            <li>Jinhyun Jeon (DessertSpoon Series)</li>


        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>While surveying other artist's work, both related and unrelated to my interests in comfort, synchronization, and human physiology, I noted the kinds of work that I tended to find most inspiring. Those aspects included: 
          <ol>
            <li>1. Work that is empathetic.</li>
            <li>2. Work that is focused on multi-sensory stimulation </li>
            <li>3. Work that is experienced alone.</li>
            <li>4. Work that is dreamy and delightful.</li>
            <li>5. Work that promotes tranquility and joy. </li>
            <li>6. Work that helps people emotionally connect with themselves, other animals, or the natural environment.</li>
            <li>7. Work that is soft, colorful, and inviting.</li>
          </ol>

        <h1>Second Research Question</h1>
        <p>After researching the field and collecting data, my research question became: </p>
        <p>What is the relationship between our physical bodies, sensory input, physical objects, and our sense of calm, comfort, and ease?</p>though I know that will change upon further reflection.

        <h2>Expert Interview </h2>

        <p>An interview with Susan Pitler, a psychotherapist who focuses on treating patients using somatic experiencing techniques was conducted on Tuesday, Oct 5. A partial transcript from the first hour of the conversation is <a href=InterviewSusanPitler.pdf><b>HERE.</b></a></p>

        <p> Our conversation was more than two hours, but I collected the detailed takeaways in a document <a href=ConversationNotes.pdf><b>HERE.</b></a></p>
        <p>Major terms/concepts that she mentioned that I will continue to investigate:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Autonomic nervous system</li>
          <li>2. Sympathetic nervous system</li>
          <li>3. Parasympathetic nervous system </li>
          <li>4. Polyvagal nerve</li>
          <li>5. Co-regulation</li>
          <li>6. Orienting </li>
          <li>7. Sensory-related methods of de-activating an activation state including: heat, cold, massage, music, humming, and curling up</li>
        </ol></p>
<p>I am adding that to a list that I alread compiled after my conversation with Professor Sareen that included words like:</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Homeostatis</li>
  <li>Emotional regulation</li>
  <li>Physical regulation</li>
  <li>Warm technologu</li>
  <li>Soft technology</li>
  <li>Introceptive experiences</li>
</ol>
</p>
    <p>One of the more worrisome aspects of the conversation I had with Susan focused on how individual notions of comfort and safety are, because we all have different experiences and assocations with trauma. I am concerned that building something to address stress and trauma will not be customizable or personalizable enough to address people's specific needs.</p>

     <h1>Third Research Question</h1>

    <p>During this process of research and discovery, I also have begun to grativate back to speculative questions around technology, and particularly, how technology might operate if it were to be calm, comforting, friendly, or soft. After spending time with my pet rabbits, I began to consider human and animal interactions, particularly whether living (and co-sleeping) with other mammals help humans feel comfortable and safe. Research suggests that there is a health benefit to friendly interactions with pets, and that there is a historic and cultural precedence for sleeping with animals, but because animals move around at night (and their dander can exacerbate allergies), science is torn about whether co-sleeping can be characterized as a wholly beneficial practice. So my research question has now become:</p>

    <h3>Can technology take inspiration from non-human mammalian physiology to enhance the human experience of coziness, comfort, and rest?</h3>

    <p>I think a question that puts technology at the forefront still allows me to focus on ideas of softness, comfort, and safety, but through a speculative design lens that feels more relevant to my interests, provides more room for imagination, and is less tied to individual traumas and sensory associations.</p>

    <h1>7-in-7: Prototype Exercise</h1>

    <p>For my 7-in-7 projects, I am prioritizing  my object's ultimate user experience, trying to create simple objects to help me hone in on the aspects of mammalian physiology I may want to emulate. As a secondary priority, I am using this time to experiment with different forms and materials, in the hopes that I find something to move forward with.</p>   

    <h2>Monday, November 1, 2021 (Day One)</h2>

    <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>Today I experimented with whether hearing a heartbeat through a pillow inspired rest. I began by cutting and folding a pale beige-pink rayon velvet to create a 15" x 10" pillow.</p>

     <figure>
           <iframe
          width="400px"

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>Creating and stuffing the pillow.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

    <p>Once I hot-glued the edges together, I stuffed the pillow with fill, leaving one side open. The idea was to leave a way to slide my phone inside the pillow so I could listen to a recorded heartbeat sound "through" the fill.</p>

    <figure>
           <iframe
          width="225px"
          height="400px"

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>Leaving one side open to slide my phone inside.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

      <p>After testing a number of different recordings, I found <a href="https://youtu.be/SGKoUGWjIa0"> this slow, soothing heartbeat sound </a>that I could play inside the pillow. I played it on my phone, placed my phone inside the pillow, and laid down to try and rest.</p>

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <p>I learned some interesting things while prototyping:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 1:</b>The heartbeat sound on the recording was quiet, and I was worried that it would be further muffled by the fill once the phone was inside the pillow. Instead, once I laid my head on the pillow, I realized the sound was much louder than it was when I was holding my phone regularly. The weight of my head on the fill meant that my ear ended being very close to my phone once I was laying down.</li>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 2:</b>Although research suggests that a lot of people enjoy heartbeat sounds while they sleep, I found the noise a little interruptive. I kept feeling jolted awake by the sound, rather than lulled into rest and relaxation.</li>
      <li><b>Material Takeaway:</b> I really enjoyed the feel and color of the rayon velvet that this object was made out of. It's soft and inviting. The fill was also deeply soft.</li>
      <li><b>Form Takeaway:</b> My focus really wasn't on creating an exerimental form for this round. This pillow supported my head, but would not, by itself, enhance my feeling of rest.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  <h2>Tuesday, November 2, 2021 (Day Two)</h2>

  <h3>The process</h3>

    <p>Today, inspired by the idea of a small mammal sleeping around someone's neck, I decided to create a wearable. My idea was to make an object that had stuffing, like a pillow, but also included wire that could be wrapped and molded around the body to create some compression, like a hug might. Finally, I wanted to insert a vibrating phone to see if I liked the feeling of something "purring" near my heart. I used the same rayon velvet that I had used for the previous object.</p>

          <figcaption>Tracing the general shape of my object before cutting.

        </figure>

    <p>I had initially planned to use thinner, more malleable wire, but found that, because of Halloween, stores were low on stock. To make up for it, I took apart and straightened two wire hangers in the hopes that the wire would still give my objet a moldable quality. To insert them into the object, I glued them into the lower hem before closing the object and stuffing it.</p>

           <iframe
          width="400px"

          <figcaption>Adding wire to the object in the hopes that it would make it more malleable.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

      <p>After creating the object, I inserted my phone in the end (near my heart), and set it on vibrate so that I could experience a "purring" effect on my body.</p>

          <figcaption>The final prototype before I inserted my phone.

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <p>I learned some interesting things while prototyping:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 1:</b>The wire was terrible. It didn't conform to my body, and made the entire object more awkward than it would have felt had it just been cut and stuffed correctly. It actually took away from this object's ability to be comfortable. </li>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 2:</b>The vibration feeling was lovely, and I liked that I felt it in staccato. Light vibration might be something I want to continue to consider.</li>
      <li><b>Material Takeaway:</b>I used the same rayon velvet as before, and continued to appreciate it.</li>
      <li><b>Form Takeaway:</b> Although this form was more interesting to consider than my basic pillow, it was ultimately ineffective. I wanted to build something that both hugged me and replicated a feeling of something on my chest, but the awkwaredness of the wire and the lightness of the fill made it feel more like a terrible neck pillow or home-made costume. I don't think this is the shape I am going for.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Wednesday, November 3, 2021 (Day Three)</h2>

  <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>Today, I decided to build on my research from yesterday to create a vibrating footstool. I wanted to continue to experiment with the same "purring" vibration that I had enjoyed yesterday, but build something that focused on a different area of the body and use a new different fabric, artificial silk.</p>

          <figcaption>Resting my feet on the footstool.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <p>A few takeaways from today's project:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 1:</b>The purring effect was still lovely, but felt overwhelming when focused on my feet. Even with the fill (and wearing socks), the sensation was too extreme and I did not enjoy it as much as I had when the vibration was located near my heart. </li>
      <li><b>Material Takeaway:</b>Although the artificial silk was quite soft, it didn't convey the same sense of comfort that the rayon velvet had. It felt cheaper and less luxurious. </li>
      <li><b>Form Takeaway:</b> I thought that focusing on the feet would engender a sense of comfort (people talk about "kicking back and relaxing," and "putting your feet up" as a way of talking about relaxation and rest). Instead, the sensations that I felt through the bottom of my feet were too amplified and intense. Moreover, the object forced me to sit upright — not a body position that I ultimately associate with rest and relaxation. </li>
    </ul>

         <h2>Thursday, November 4, 2021 (Day Four)</h2>

  <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>I decided to try and tackle how I might replicate the natural rise and fall of the body  while breathing. In order to do that, I created two sets of rib cages made out of aluminum foil. My hypoethesis was that by placing the two sides of the "ribs" under a piece of fabric and rotating them away and towards one another, I could imitate the expansion and contraction of a chest wall.</p>

    <figure>
           <iframe
          width="225px"

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>The rib cage in the closed position (contraction).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        I used an extra piece of artifical silk that I had leftover from yesterday's experiment to cover the ribs.

        <h3> Takeaways </h3>

          <p>I ran into some unforseen issues with the aluminum foil, namely that rough edges kept catching each other when the ribs contracted together, leading to a less than smooth movement. For that reason, I had a difficult time telling whether this was a direction that I should continue to pursue. I tried my experiment with my hands as well, but I'm still not sure. I may need to replicate it with other materials to see if a "breathing" pattern can really be replicated. I am also going to revisit the movement to see if a hinge ribs that move on a hinge (rather than rotate) looks more like breathing.</p>

       <h2>Friday, November 5, 2021 (Day Five)</h2>

  <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>Today I decided to get back to experimenting with form. Over the last few days, I've been thinking about what it might take to create a mattress topper. Something that could be draped over a bed with strategically-placed masses/bulky areas that could echo the feeling of sleeping with a pack of wolves or a hibernating bear.</p>

    <p>I used pillows and a piece of cotton fleece to test a number of different configurations on my living room floor.</p>

    <p>The three most successful formations were:</p>

         <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <p>A few takeaways from today's project:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Form takeaway:</b>I really enjoyed testing these configurations! Some were more successful than others, but the three that I highlighted made me feeling immediately restful when I positioned myself between the bulky pillows. I'd like to have other people test the configurations to give me feedback about them, but feels like a promising direction.</li>
      <li><b>Material Takeaway:</b> The cotton fleece was lovely. Soft to the touch, comforting, but not as obvious as a faux fur material.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Saturday, November 6, 2021 (Day Six)</h2>

  <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>Frustrated by how poorly my last experiment around breathing went, I decided that I would commit today to building another lung prototype to see if I could make fabric rise and fall in a way that looked similar to a sleeping animal. Inspired by my classmates, Franco Chen and Peilin Chen and their previous work with inflatable materials, I decided to build my second lung prototype out of plastic drop cloth and painters' paint. </p>

    <figure>
           <iframe
          width="225px"

          <figcaption>Securing the seams with painters tape and attaching the "lung" to a piece of plastic tubing.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I decided to forgo automating this process at all, instead, relying on my breath to inflate the lung. My focus was on whether or not the lung held air, and whether it looked like a resting animal when it was covered with fabric. I figured that if it worked, I could always work out how to automate the inflation/deflation cycle at a later date.</p>

        <figure>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pWqkHg8EKE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </figure>

        <p>Once I had successfully tested whether the lung could inflate or not, I covered it with a faux fur to see if it "read" like a resting animal when positioned underneath fabric.</p>

        <figure>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXfZsPNuaIY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </figure>

        <p>In addition to the lung prototype, I also sourced two new fabrics to consider incorporating into my final project: one short-haired faux fur, and the other long-haired faux fur. Both stark white. 

           <figure>
           <iframe
          width="400px"
          height="225px"

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>Both fabrics side-by-side (L: short, R: long).
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The long-haired faux fur was soft, but shed too easily to be useful. The short-haired faux fur had a mammalian quality, but was not as enjoyable as the cotton fleece and rayo velvet I previously worked with.</p> 



        <h3> Takeaways </h3>

          <p>This was a much more successful experiment replicating lung function and the shape an animal makes when it is sleeping. I realize now that timing is going to be a fundamental part of my project — if the rise and fall of my object goes too fast, it might invoke a stress response, rather than a restful one.</p>

          <h2>Sunday, November 7, 2021 (Day Seven)</h2>

  <h3>The Process</h3>

    <p>After yesterday's small success with the mini-version of a lung made out of plastic as well as my initial findings with the pillow formations on the floor on Friday (Day Five), I decided to create a human-sized prototype that combined those successful elements together into one large form/user experience. For this project, I asked my husband, Vann, to help me test my prototype and give me feedback about his experience. </p>

          <figcaption>I took the open end of the hose and tried to blow up the plastic lung next to him.

<p>In the end, the experiment was not successful. No matter how much air I blew into the inflatable, it was too large and never filled with air. </p>

<h3> Takeaways </h3>

          <p>I was really disappointed with this one. Before I began, I thought that I had found a way forward with this project, and that this final piece would be an effective amalgamation of all that I have learned over the course of the week. Instead, it was a miserable failure. I'm glad this isn't 8 in 8 because I am really not sure where or how to proceed from here.</p>

          <p>I was able to ask my husband for feedback about whether the cotton fleece or rayon velvet felt better to him. He liked the velvet because it was multi-directional and he felt that encouranged him to "pet" the pillow as a way to self-soothe.

<h1>Prototype 1</h1>

After a long and arduous 7-in-7, I was still searching for a form and function that would align with my investigatory interests and creative values. I took note of my classmates' feedback and began to consider the implications of creating something that was comfortable, vs. something that held people to account.

          </iframe>
          <figcaption>My notes from class feedback included things like: reconsider the heartbeat, think about light and warmth, think about marsupial animals and pouches, figure out whether this work is product-focused, critical, or speculative, work with more materials/work on form, and feel free to change my question if I decide to take a critical approach. I also wrote down thoughts like: "humans used to co-exist with animals and now they don't," and "heartbeats slow --> fast ---> dead. Maybe in a way that echos extinction?""

          </iframe>
          <figcaption>After class, while brainstorming, I grappled with value-related questions like: "Who should be comfortable and who shouldn't be?" and "If I'm making people uncomfortable...why?" I also considered forms like the hammock (womb-like), experiences that involved breathing and heartbeats, and (clearly referencing Dunne and Raby's <a href="http://dunneandraby.co.uk/content/books/66/0"><i>Huggable Atomic Mushroom</i>(2004-2005)</a>) other snuggly objects that were "shaped as doom."

          src="Prototype1Notes_3.jpg">
          </iframe>
          <figcaption>I also mused on our relationship with the natural world and the suffering that animals experience as a direct and indirect result of human activity. I wrote: There is a lot of unseen suffering, we barely consider animal death and extinction. The scale of animal death is astronomical. Animal life is worthy of consideration, we are equal to animals, not above them. Different forms of awareness are valid — a diverse way of seeing the world is a good thing. I thought about forms that would "give people a place to digest," difficult truths. Something that might be shaped like a stomach or mouth to add surreality to the experience.

          </iframe>
          <figcaption>Finally, I considered our cultural context, and how difficult the last few years have been for most people. I thought about what it would mean to make something that made people feel uncomfortable in a time of extreme discomfort, and considered forms that might help people reconnect with themslves instead of lecturing them or using the space to explore difficult subjects.
        </figure>

        <p>After that brainstorm, I surveyed friends and family about what they might prefer to experience, and choose to design a product that would comfort individuals, rather than challenge them. I thought, given the state of the world, I should focus on making people more comfortable, rather than less. With that creative goal in mind, I began to experiment again, essentially creating a series of second "7-in-7" style prototypes to see if I couldn't find a unique direction to pursue. </p>

<h1>Feedback and Next Steps</h1>

<p>Unfortunately for my pillow idea, it wasn't received very well. The class rightly pointed out that it looked out of place in a home and that it was too similar to other products already on the market. They challenged me to think more experimentally, to consider how I could push the non-human, mammalian physiology aspect more significantly, and think about how much more I could do. I went back to the drawing board and began to brainstorm again.</p>

<h1>Prototype 1.5</h1>

<p>Tasked with reconsidering my concept, I revisited the idea of making my project more critical, and came up with some ideas that I thought could visually communicate my concerns with modern human life, and particularly, our troublesome relationship with animals. I wanted to continue to consider comfort, but to think about it through a fine art lens, creating either an experimental form to showcase a new kind of comfort, or by using this project to explore the uncomfortable environmental truths that help us maintain our phsysical ease and sense of well-being.

<h2>Form Exploration</h2>

<p>New ideas for forms that I could build for my final project included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. A chaise lounge that operated to reveal animal skeletons at it's base, speaking to the animal suffering that supports our current, comfortable modern lifestyles.</li>
  <li>2. a large, plushy chair shaped like a pile of meerkats.</li>
  <li>3.A hammock made of plastic bags on the outside and plushy material on the inside, speaking to our need to find an organic way to live within a manufactured world.</li>
  <li>4. A shelter where expectations were flipped: the exterior was polished and modern, and the interior wild and animalistic. I thought it could speak to the costs and benefits of living seperately from the rest of the animal kingdom.

          <figcaption>Sketches from brainstorm as I revisited my concept. 
        </figure>  

<p>After speaking with Harpreet about my potential directions, I settled on creating a shelter that took a critical view of our modern life by investigating the intersection between modern comfort and existential angst.</p>

<h2>Material exploration</h2>

<p>Because I wanted the exterior to be modern and industrial, I decided to create a cubic form. Because I wanted the interior to evoke a feeling of both coziness and dread, I decided to take inspiration from mammalian predator dens, specifically those of hibernating bears. Like a bear den, I wanted people to experience entering the structure and feeling struck by the interior being immediately cozy and supremely comfortable. That feeling would then be slowly supplanted by a growing anxiety and gnawing dread. For that reason, I decided to use faux fur on the interior and to create two massive furry shapes that people could lay on or in-between. I also decided to use audio to enhance the feeling of the space and, referencing my past research on co-regulation, take the participant on the emotional journey.</p>

<p>I wanted the exterior to contrast heavily with the interior, and came up with a number of materials that I thought might be meaningful and visually interesting. They included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1. Bubblewrap: Padding that could speak to our plastic present.</li>
  <li>2. Acrylic sheets: Slick, minimalist, modern, and beautiful, but quite plasticine and wholly removed from nature. </li>
  <li>3. Mirror: Reflecting not only the comfortable-but-anxious modern world quite literally, but also speaking to the idea that we take comfort in our human body being "different" than other animals or natural systems.</li>
<li>4. Cardboard: specifically, an Amazon box. Reflecting the comfort we take in modern convenience, even when it's unsustainable.</li>
<li>5. White plastic Bags: Similar to cardboard, convenience-as-comfort, even though it is awful for us. </li>
<li>6. Gummy Bears: Colorful, glossy, sweet figures we take pleasure in but also symbolize our disastrous, often lethal relationship with sugar and manufactured foods. I liked thinking about how we've reduced natural predators to cartoon characters that kill us as we eat them for comfort. I also thought that the material/bear form contrast would be interesting.</li>

<p>Once again, I sought Harpreet's advice, and was gratified to hear that some materials made more sense than others. Once I had workable list of a few directions, I created my first prototype to test exterior materials and survey classmates and friends about whether any resonated with them (and what meanings they conveyed).

<h1>Prototype 2</h1>

<p>Survey results indicated that most people could look at a mirrored surface and self-generate a meaning that was similar to my artistic intent. I decided to move forward with a reflective, silver surface for that reason, and because I was excited by the idea that it could be read both symbolically and literally as a "reflection" of our modern lifestyles.</p>

<p>For my prototype 2, I created two more forms. One with a solid reflective surface and one with cut outs that were meant to echo the shape of windows, as if it was a city building. I brought my two prototypes into my class, and had my classmates help me decide which was the more appealing and more meaningful direction for me to take.</p>

  <p>I also asked my classmates to listen to a series of audio tracks that I engineered to test the emotional effect of listening to heartbeats and breathing at different speeds and rhythms.</p>

  <p>Selected tracks included:</p>

</audio>

<p>After testing the sounds and forms with classmates, I decided to move forward with the form that had a fully reflective surface, and the sound that featured two heartbeats and breathing that got increasingly louder and more rapid with time.</p>

<h1>Final Build-Out</h1>

<p>Once I had decided on a form, exterior material, interior material and set up, and audio experience, it was time to build the structure. I wanted the space to feel comfortable and as accessible as possible, so I decided to make a shelter that was 5'x5'. In the interest of time, in an effort to keep the structure easy to relocate, and in order to be cost-effective, I built the frame out of 2 in. x 3 in. lumber, and the walls out of a twinwall polycarbonate material that I hand-applied a chromatic vinyl to in order to make the exterior surface reflective. The interior was created with 3" foam and pillow fill.</p>

<figcaption>In response to participant feedback, I created a final audio file that had a much longer introductory "quiet" period before the sound began to ramp up. I also added a chime at the end to indicate to participants that the experience was over.</figcaption>

<h1>Final tests:</h1>

<p>Because the form was too large to move from my apartment, I had two groups of participants. The first, a group of 18 in total experienced <i>Modern Nature</i> remotely, listening to the audio track and looking at pictures of the form. The second group, a smaller cohort of 8 participants, came to my apartment and experienced the structure first-hand.<p>

<p>Due to the emotional nature of the project, I declined to videotape participants during their experience, as I felt it was too invasive. Instead, I created a short survey to give me a sense of their emotional reaction to the piece, as well as associations that they had with the structure's exterior and interior qualities.<p>

<p>Sample survey:</p>

        </figure>  

<p>In five days, I collected 26 surveys and mapped the participant responses so I could get a sense of any emotional trends people felt. Exactly as I hoped, most people tended to feel more comfortable in the first few moments, and markedly less comfortable by the time they completed their experience.</p>

<p>I also created word clouds with the participant's word association answers, in the hopes of getting a general sense of their impression.</p>

          <figcaption>Interior word associations</figcaption>
        </figure>  

<p>After noting participant survey answers (and speaking to people 1:1), it is clear that the structure succeeded in that people attached the appropriate meanings and associations to its exterior, and went through the emotional journey that I had hoped they would. There are still some elements that need further iteration, though.</p>

<p>If I were to move forward with this piece, I would:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1. Re-consider the interior (a portion of the project that was hard to test before full build-out)to make sure that people more closely associated it with organic, wild, natural environments and animals.</li>
  <li>2. Allow people to customize the intensity of their experience: some people reported after their experience that the sound was unbearable. Others suggested that I should ramp it up further.</li>
<li>3. Add a tunnel or curtain to allow maximum sensory deprivation and a full-body immersive experience.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Addendum</h1>

<p>After I presented my final project in class, the visiting professors gave me food for thought about the future direction of this piece. They suggested that I consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Looking into human-made artificial habitats for animals that wouldn't survive without human intervention (or are otherwise wholly dependent on humans for their survival now), and consider how they can serve as a counterpoint to, or enhancement of, the project as it currently exists.</li>
<li>2. Recasting this project as a speculative piece, rather than a momentary fine art experience. Thinking about "outside rooms" as a concept that people could build into their homes in a future with less access to natural spaces. Keeping my materials DIY and presenting my speculative concept as a fine-art piece as to avoid negative product-oriented associations.</li></ul></p>
