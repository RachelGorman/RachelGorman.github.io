      <h2> Considerations and Initial Questions</h2>
      <p>I am interested in exploring about how design and technology can use synchronization to help people regulate their physiology and feel more comfortable and at ease. Initial guiding questions include:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. How can I help people feel calmer? More centered and aligned, less anxious and tense?</li>
        <li>2. How can I create a technology that feels comfortable or puts people at ease? Can I create a technology that feels inimate and gentle, empathetic and kind?</li>
        <li>3. How can technology help people soothe and self-regulate, meditate or be more mindful?</li>
        <li>4. Is there a way to synch ourselves to a healthier rhythm or better breathing pattern?</li>
        <li>5. If we feel something else's breathing, does our own breathing change?</li>
        <li>6. Can you power something with your body's electricity?</li>
        <li>7. Can we create tech that mimics the feeling of being around friendly animals or pets?</li>
        <li>8. Can we use biomaterials to achieve my objective?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>To begin, I wanted to examine whether people were as anxious or tense as I presumed and what the nature of their anxieties were. I also observed my partner and my own behavior over a period of time to see if we engaged in self-regulating activities (and what those activities were).

           <figcaption>I created a physical data set that tracked the overt anxiety mentions I heard in a three-day period and served as a visual metaphor, reflecting a feeling of being "tied up in knots."

          <figcaption>I also tracked the subjects that people tended to worry about in my company, and the self-soothing behaviors that my partner and I performed over a two-day period.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I also wanted researched information that I thought was peritent to the project, and gathered a list of artists, orgaizations, and experts whose work spoke to the subjects I wanted to explore. They included: 
          <ol>
            <li>Roos Meerman/Filip Studios (KozieMe, Tactile Orchestra)</li>
            <li>Morton Heilig (Sensorama)</li>
            <li>Ultraleap (Hand-tracking/Haptics)</li>
            <li>Verner Panton (Visiona 2)</li>
            <li>Jinhyun Jeon (DessertSpoon Series)</li>


        <h1>Reflections</h1>
        <p>While surveying other artist's work, both related and unrelated to my interests in comfort, synchronization, and human physiology, I noted the kinds of work that I tended to find most inspiring. Those aspects included: 
          <ol>
            <li>1. Work that is empathetic.</li>
            <li>2. Work that is focused on multi-sensory stimulation </li>
            <li>3. Work that is experienced alone.</li>
            <li>4. Work that is dreamy and delightful.</li>
            <li>5. Work that promotes tranquility and joy. </li>
            <li>6. Work that helps people emotionally connect with themselves, other animals, or the natural environment.</li>
            <li>7. Work that is soft, colorful, and inviting.</li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Personal Inventory Survey</h2>
        <p>In order to gain a better understanding of the kinds of objects and features that people associate with comfort, I asked twenty one people to to answer the question: "what kinds of items bring you comfort or put you at ease?"

        <h1>Second Research Question</h1>
        <p>After researching the field and collecting data, my research question became: </p>
        <p>What is the relationship between our physical bodies, sensory input, physical objects, and our sense of calm, comfort, and ease?</p>though I know that will change upon further reflection.

        <h2>Expert Interview </h2>

        <p>An interview with Susan Pitler, a psychotherapist who focuses on treating patients using somatic experiencing techniques was conducted on Tuesday, Oct 5. A partial transcript from the first hour of the conversation is <a href=InterviewSusanPitler.pdf><b>HERE.</b></a></p>

        <p> Our conversation was more than two hours, but I collected the detailed takeaways in a document <a href=ConversationNotes.pdf><b>HERE.</b></a></p>
        <p>Major terms/concepts that she mentioned that I will continue to investigate:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>1. Autonomic nervous system</li>
          <li>2. Sympathetic nervous system</li>
          <li>3. Parasympathetic nervous system </li>
          <li>4. Polyvagal nerve</li>
          <li>5. Co-regulation</li>
          <li>6. Orienting </li>
          <li>7. Sensory-related methods of de-activating an activation state including: heat, cold, massage, music, humming, and curling up</li>
        </ol></p>
<p>I am adding that to a list that I alread compiled after my conversation with Professor Sareen that included words like:</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Homeostatis</li>
  <li>Emotional regulation</li>
  <li>Physical regulation</li>
  <li>Warm technologu</li>
  <li>Soft technology</li>
  <li>Introceptive experiences</li>
</ol>
</p>
    <p>One of the more worrisome aspects of the conversation I had with Susan focused on how individual notions of comfort and safety are, because we all have different experiences and assocations with trauma. I am concerned that building something to address stress and trauma will not be customizable or personalizable enough to address people's specific needs.</p>

     <h1>Third Research Question</h1>

    <p>During this process of research and discovery, I also have begun to grativate back to speculative questions around technology, and particularly, how technology might operate if it were to be calm, comforting, friendly, or soft. After spending time with my pet rabbits, I began to consider human and animal interactions, particularly whether living (and co-sleeping) with other mammals help humans feel comfortable and safe. Research suggests that there is a health benefit to friendly interactions with pets, and that there is a historic and cultural precedence for sleeping with animals, but because animals move around at night (and their dander can exacerbate allergies), science is torn about whether co-sleeping can be characterized as a wholly beneficial practice. So my research question has now become:</p>

    <h3>Can technology take inspiration from non-human mammalian physiology to enhance the human experience of coziness, comfort, and rest?</h3>

    <p>I think a question that puts technology at the forefront still allows me to focus on ideas of softness, comfort, and safety, but through a speculative design lens that feels more relevant to my interests, provides more room for imagination, and is less tied to individual traumas and sensory associations.</p>

    <h1>7-in-7: Prototype Exercise</h1>

    <p>For my 7-in-7 projects, I am prioritizing  my object's ultimate user experience, trying to create simple objects to help me hone in on the aspects of mammalian physiology I may want to emulate. As a secondary priority, I am using this time to experiment with different forms and materials, in the hopes that I find something to move forward with.</p>   

    <h2>Monday, November 1, 2021 (Day One)</h2>

    <h3>The process</h3>

    <p>Today I experimented with whether hearing a heartbeat through a pillow inspired rest. I began by cutting and folding a pale beige-pink rayon velvet to create a 15" x 10" pillow.</p>

           <iframe
          width="400px"

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>Creating and stuffing the pillow.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

    <p>Once I hot-glued the edges together, I stuffed the pillow with fill, leaving one side open. The idea was to leave a way to slide my phone inside the pillow so I could listen to a recorded heartbeat sound "through" the fill.</p>

    <figure>
           <iframe
          width="400px"

          ></iframe>
          <figcaption>Leaving one side open to slide my phone inside.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

      <p>After testing a number of different recordings, I found <a href="https://youtu.be/SGKoUGWjIa0">this slow, soothing heartbeat sounds</a>that I could play inside the pillow. I played it on my phone, placed my phone inside the pillow, and laid down to try and rest.</p>

      <h3>Takeaways</h3>

      <p>I learned some interesting things while prototyping:
      <ul>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 1:</b>The heartbeat sound on the recording was quiet, and I was worried that it would be further muffled by the fill once the phone was inside the pillow. Instead, once I laid my head on the pillow, I realized the sound was much louder than it was when I was holding my phone regularly. The weight of my head on the fill meant that my ear ended being very close to my phone once I was laying down.</li>
      <li><b>User Experience Takeaway 2:</b>Although research suggests that a lot of people enjoy heartbeat sounds while they sleep, I found the noise a little interruptive. I kept feeling jolted awake by the sound, rather than lulled into rest and relaxation.</li>
      <li><b>Material Takeaway:</b> I really enjoyed the feel and color of the rayon velvet that this object was made out of. It's soft and inviting. The fill was also deeply soft.</li>
      <li><b>Form Takeaway:</b> My focus really wasn't on creating an exerimental form for this round. This pillow supported my head, but would not, by itself, enhance my feeling of rest.</li>
